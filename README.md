## What is it?

A curated list of `.dotfiles` I use for my local development environment. This repository intended to consolidate and manage commonly used `.dotfiles` into a single place backed by a git repository.<br/>
It creates symlinks from [dotfiles directory](dotfiles) in the following manner:

- `~/.dotfiles/.dotfiles-config` - directories paths of _dotfiles repo_ and _.dotfiles symlinks_ + reload symlinks function
- `~/.dotfiles/managed/*.*` - content to symlink across all machines
- `~/.dotfiles/custom/*.*` - content to symlink in specific machines e.g. work related / personal etc..

Additionally, this repository contains:

- [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) installation script for common [packages and casks](brew) that I use
- macOS custom KeyBindings, Finder customizations, keyboard preferences and other overrides

<br>

## Getting Started

List of available `make` commands:

1. `dotfiles` - create/remove dotfiles symlinks to/from this repo
1. `brew` - (_optional_) install commonly used Homebrew [packages and casks](brew)
1. `mac` - (_optional_) macOS custom KeyBindings, Finder customizations, keyboard preferences and other overrides
1. `all` - (_optional_) execute `mac`, `dotfiles` and `brew` in this order
1. `help` - (_optional_) get available actions

<br>

## Customization

<u>**Custom**</u>

Just add any custom dotfile to `<repo-root>/dotfiles/custom/*.*` and it'll be sourced on every new shell.

**<u>Managed</u>**

For a managed content to be added across all machines using this dotfiles repo, add it to the relevant file:

- `.aliases`
- `.functions`
- `.exports`

### Transient Files

If files in `<repo-root>/dotfiles/transient` directory exists, they will be sourced along but won't get symlinked anywhere.<br/>
You can use this to export ENV vars with sensitive information such as secrets to become available on any newly opened shells. Files under `transient` folder are git ignored by default to prevent from committing to a public repository.

| It is not recommended to commit the `.secrets` transient file as it may contain sensitive information. |
